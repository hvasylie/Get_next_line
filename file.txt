Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
• What we call a “line” is a succession of characters that end with ’\n’ (ascii code
0x0a) or with End Of File (EOF).
• Your function must be prototyped as follow :
• The first parameter is the file descriptor that will be used to read.
• The second parameter is the address of a pointer to a character that will be used
to save the line read from the file descriptor.
• The return value can be 1, 0 or -1 depending on whether a line has been read, when the reading has been completed, or if an error has happened respectively.
• Your function get_next_line must return its result without ’\n’.
• Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the end of the text, no matter the size of either the text or one of its lines.
